An interactive tech demo inspired by Crossy Road using three.js where I put together a scene with an orthographic camera that follows the player, a few simplified 3D objects with some texture, lights and shadows, and a basic game logic that randomly generates a level that you can walk through. Ye. Pretty cool.
